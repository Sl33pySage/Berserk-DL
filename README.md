# Welcome to my Berserk download repo!  
This repo houses the code I used to download berserk from a reader site: https://readberserk.com/  
This software is provided AS IS with no warranty, execute/run it at your own risk, however I reccomend not to run it.  
Due to the nature of this type of script, this can count as a DOS attack with how much its hitting the CDN's, if multiple people run it at the same time you have a fully fledged DDOS attack against the readberserk site and its CDN's :(  
  
I wrote this because there werent any succint downloads for berserk manga, and i couldn't be bothered going to the site everytime i wanted to read, I have compiled the output into a zip file so you can download it yourself without having to run the script and put load on the CDN's :)  
  
If you are the copyright owner or would like to have this removed for legal reasons, do not hesitate to contact me :)  
  
## Getting the Files  
This repo has the pdf's and Images for the berserk manga from chapter A-P, 0-364 in both image and pdf format.  
To download the hole manga, you can use the releases, of which there are 2:

[PDF's](https://github.com/s1ddly/Berserk-DL/releases/tag/Pdfs)   
I have had to split the file into 2 smaller zips(githubs max file size is 2gb)  
  
Additionally, you can download individual chapters from the downloads folder:

## Issues  
Chapter 83 and 364 had issues with the line endings(they were using the windows carriage return in the html, meaning bash and curl couldn't parse it properly)  
I had to manually download the images for those ones.
