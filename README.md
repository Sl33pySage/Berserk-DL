Hi and welcome to my berserk downloader repo

This repo houses the code I used to download berserk from a reader site: https://readberserk.com/

This software is provided AS IS with no warranty, execute/run it at your own risk.
I wrote this because there werent any succint downloads for berserk manga, and i couldn't be bothered going to the site everytime i wanted to read, I have compiled the output into a zip file so you can download it yourself without having to run the script and put load on the CDN's :)

Chapter 83 and 364 had issues with the line endings(they were using the windows carriage return in the html, meaning bash and curl couldn't parse it properly)
Please do not execute this code yourself, this can count as a DOS attack with how much its hitting the CDN's, if multiple people run it at the same time you have a fully fledged DDOS attack :(

If you are the copyright owner or would like to have this removed for legal reasons, do not hesitate to contact me :)
